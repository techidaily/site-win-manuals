## Urgent Alert: Windows 11 Versions 21H2 & 22H2 Hit EOL - Upgrade Immediately to Avoid Risks![ZDNet]

![Windows 11 Update](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/a3d7f6204a4a80c657ff5a478fcd7dde3d2564e1/2024/09/11/b679a3e9-5816-4292-8618-8cad24cce468/figure-top-update-your-windows-11-pc-to-version-23h2-or-else.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Haven't updated your Windows 11 PC in a while? Then you could find yourself on the outs with Microsoft. 

Windows 11 21H2 and 22H2 are no longer supported by the folks in Redmond. This means that anyone still running these versions won't receive future bug fixes, security patches, or other updates. And that could place your computer at a greater risk for malware, security flaws, and other threats.

**Also: [Yes, you can upgrade that old PC to Windows 11, even if Microsoft says no. These readers proved it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/yes-you-can-upgrade-that-old-pc-to-windows-11-even-if-microsoft-says-no-these-readers-proved-it/)**

On Sunday, Microsoft revised its [Windows 11 release information page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows11-release-information) to indicate the retirement of the two older versions, listing both 21H2 and 22H2 as having reached the end of servicing for Windows 11 Home, Pro, Pro Education, and Pro for Workstations. Only the Enterprise and Education editions are spared; they're still able to receive updates to Windows 11 22H2 until October 14 of 2025.

How do you know which version you're running? That's easy enough. Head to Settings, select System, and then click About. Scroll down to the section for Windows specifications to find the version. If Windows 11 23H2 is listed, then you're fine. But what if you're stuck with an older edition? In that case, you can update your PC yourself, or Microsoft will now do it for you.

**Also: [Microsoft is going to start charging for Windows 10 updates next year. Here's how much](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-going-to-start-charging-for-windows-10-updates-next-year-heres-how-much/)**

Go to Settings, select Windows Update, and click the button for "Check for Updates." Microsoft will download and install the latest updates, which will include 23H2\. If you don't do this yourself and automatic updates are turned on, the update will automatically run as part of this month's Patch Tuesday, rolled out on September 10.

Keeping track of Windows updates can be challenging and frustrating, especially with so many of them pushed out on a regular and irregular basis. Microsoft has tried to streamline the major updates by launching them annually and naming them with the year and period. But the names can be confusing since we're almost in the final quarter of 2024 and Windows 11 is still stuck on a 2023 version. In the midst of this messiness, making sure your PC is fully protected against security hazards is the most critical task.

On its [Windows Message Center page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/windows-message-center), Microsoft issued this warning:

**"**The October 2024 security update is the last security release for Enterprise and Education editions of Windows 11, version 21H2 and Home and Pro editions of Windows 11, version 22H2\. After this date, devices running these editions will no longer receive monthly security and preview updates containing protections from the latest security threats."

In the following message, Microsoft explains that it will perform the update if you fail to do so:

"To help keep you protected and productive, Windows Update will automatically initiate a feature update for Windows 11 Home and Pro devices that are not managed by IT departments when these are nearing end of servicing. Moving to Windows 11, version 23H2 keeps your device supported and receiving monthly updates that are critical to security and ecosystem health."

How long will it be before Windows 11 23H2 is no longer supported? That depends on when 24H2 is released to the general public. Right now, this year's major Windows 11 update is officially available only on [Copilot PCs](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5043950-windows-11-version-24h2-support-2fd719b6-8c26-469f-99fe-832eb1b702d7) and [through Release Preview builds](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2024/05/22/releasing-windows-11-version-24h2-to-the-release-preview-channel/). Let's assume that 24H2 kicks off to everyone by the end of 2024\. Then the current flavor of 23H2 should have at least another year of life left before Microsoft forces you to update again.
